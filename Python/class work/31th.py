favorite_memory=("""In the quiet of the summer's glow,
I wandered where the soft winds blow.
By the lakeside, we stood so still,
Watching time bend to nature's will.

The sun above, a golden hue,
Reflected in the waters too.
We laughed and talked, hearts so free,
The world around us, just you and me.

A memory etched in the softest light,
A moment captured, forever bright.
Though seasons change and years may fly,
That summer day will never die.""")
